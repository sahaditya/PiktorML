ML according to Arthur Samuel:
It is the field of study that provide ability to a computer to learn without being explicitly programmed.

ML according to Tom Mitchell:
A computer program is said to learn from experience E with respect to some class of tasks T and performance measure P, if its performance at tasks in T, as measured by P, improves with experience E then it will be said as Machine learning.

Using an example of machine learning problem (Anything that you can pose) explain it using the terms in Question2 in your own words:
A computer should predict a certain thing based on the given task, for example, there is number series problem [2,6,18,?], these are the series with multiplication of 3. So the computer should be able to predict the number as 54 [18*3] by looking previous number and the relation.
